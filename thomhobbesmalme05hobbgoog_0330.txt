“ Tms Latine Poem writ by the famous Mr. Thomas Hobs of
Malmsbury, bath got such a reputation, that many English
readers had a great desire to be acquainted with it3 for whose
sakes it is now translated into English, although without the
knowledge of Mr. Hobs3 who it is hoped will not be dis-
pleased with this attempt, which is lest to others judgments,
whether well or in. Reader, Farewell: but do not forget ω
peruse that excellent Translation of Homer by Mr. Hobs. Ῑ
think the most exact and best translation that ere I saw.n
